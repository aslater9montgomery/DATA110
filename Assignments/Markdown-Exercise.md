Hello, welcome to my Github page. While this is an assignment, I do wish to have *lots* of fun with it while trying it out. Truth be told, I actually have *some* experience working with formats such as this. Granted, it was for blog writing rather than making devlogs, repositories, and so on. Instead of using asterisks for *italics* I would have to type out the html code [i] and [/i], or [b] and [/b] for **bold** to properly format words, sentences, bullet points, and so on. It was a bit tedious but weirdly fun.

It actually makes me a bit glad that I have that experience so I'm not stepping into uncharted or unknow territory. In this particular assignment. Right now, I am currently listening to [Taco's Puttin On The Ritz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsGjFh1ke44) as of typing this. As I'm typing this, I actually have a physically written list out that has all of the things I must include in this project. Such as,
* Author Section
* Headers
* Emphasis
  * **Bold**
  * *Italics*
* List
  * Ordered
  * Un-Ordered
* Image
* Block Quote
* Inline Code and Code Blocks
* Table
* Task List
* Footnote

Of which I am checking off as I include them. Which does help in giving me an idea of what to include and write. In this case, I will provide a soup recipe that I use quite frequently.

## Vegetable Cream Soup For One
### I, Ahyoka Slater, take no responsibility if you mess up the recipe and cause any bodily harm to your person(s). Happy cooking.

**Ingredients**
* One carrot
* One saucepan
* Water
* Garlic
* One potato
* One celery stalk
* three mushrooms, either shitake or portebella
* One onion
* One boulion cube, preferably chicken
* Pepper
* Salt
* Rosemary
* 236mL Carton of Heavy Whipping Cream

**Preperation**
1. Chop up your carrot and potato into small bite-sized peices
2. Finely chop garlic
3. Place chopped garlic, carrots and potatos into sauce pan.
4. Fill sauce pan with enough water to cover the chopped garlic, potatos and carrots
5. Stir.
6. Put sauce pan on burner.
7. Set burner to medium.
8. Chop celery, mushrooms, and onion. Set aside.
9. Return to sauce pan.
10. Add boulion cube to simmering water, chopped garlic, potatos and carrots.
11. Add a dash of pepper and salt to saucepan.
12. Stir.
13. Grind up a small amount of rosemary and add to the saucepan.
14. Stir.
15. Cover saucepan.
16. Wait until chopped carrots and potatos are tender enough that they can easily be peirced with a knife
17. Once carrots and potatos reach that tenderness add the chopped celery, mushrooms, and onions.
18. Stir.
19. Add more water to saucepan until it covers the new addtion of vegetables.
20. Stir.
21. OPTIONAL: You may need to add more seasonings such as salt, pepper, or half of a boulion cube. As the addition of water may dilute the broth.
22. Check to see if the chopped onions have become soft.
23. If the onions are at a desired tenderness, turn off the burner.
24. Pour in a small amount of the heavy whipped cream.
25. NOTE: Your soup should be light, it shouldn't be thick. If it is thick then you have either messed up by not adding enoug water, or adding to much cream.
26. Serve immeadiately.

***And that was a recipe made with my favorite vegetable!***

Since blockquote has the word *qote* in it, I figure I should say a quote.

>It sucks to suck, so you either keep being on your knees or you get up and get better.

Here is another one.

>When it comes to any skill that is learned such as coding, art, writing, or making music an unfortunate truth is that there will **always** be someone better than you, no matter how high you go there will be someone higher than you. Because of this, there's no point in getting jealous or angry, just work hard to surpass those who are better than you.

Both of these quotes were made by me.

This is the part where I have to add the code block, unfortunately, **I've never coded in my life.** So I don't even know what to put here. As such, I will do what I usually do and list music.

Finally, for my tables. Here's a 5/5 reveiw score for different spreadsheet programs I've used.

| Program           | Score | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Sheets     | 4.5/5 | It's almost as good as Excel, but it can be very lacking in the more important and needed aspects.                                                                                          |
| OnlyOffice Sheets | 3/5   | It's okay as a starting point to play around with as a free offline alternative, good for simple processes and functions requiring of spreadsheet software, however it can be very glitchy. |
| Excel             | 4.5/5 | The ultimate spreadsheet software, too bad it's expensive.                                                                                                                                  |

### Goals For 2024
